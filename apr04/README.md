## Concurrency
- We still need to know about concurrency/race conditions, but not really Scheme syntax
- Do understand mutex locks
- Do have read the section on concurrency
- A mutex belongs to the thread, and the thread has to release it
- A semaphore can be grabbed by one thread but released by another
- Scam has semaphore as its only concurrency construct
