- Normal, and applicative order, will both be on the first test
- Normal order delays evaluation of arguments
- "I'm gonna lecture some on stuff
- "It's not like the book from CS201, where I don't understand half of it."

- Special forms like `and`, `or`, `cond`, use normal order
- Typically normal order is not as efficient as applicative order

## The First Test
- Parsing, Evaluation, Environments


## Chapter 2
- Talks much about abstraction layers
- Lisp's primary data structure is a cons cell
